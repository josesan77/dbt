## Data Build Tool

[Docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/)

"dbt is a transformation workflow that helps you get more work done while producing higher quality results. You can use dbt to modularize and centralize your analytics code, while also providing your data team with guardrails typically found in software engineering workflows. Collaborate on data models, version them, and test and document your queries before safely deploying them to production, with monitoring and visibility."

I found this database wrangling/managing tool online and found it quite impressive 'at first sight'. Here you find some application starting with a basic setup, a starter kit, in which I tried to explain all dependencies that are required to set up a functional system.
